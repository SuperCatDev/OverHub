        Overwatch test servers released an update, along with which a new map appeared.
        This time the players will go to Paris. Narrow streets, cabaret Luna and the Eiffel Tower in the background -
        Blizzard tried to convey the atmosphere of the city of love as much as possible.
        Perhaps the map will appear on the official servers for Valentine\'s Day.
        Many players have already found some similarities between the new map and locations from Bioshock Infinite.
        On the map "Paris" you can find a piano. Players are already competing in their musical abilities.
        Accompanied on the piano will be omnica singer, which entertains players attack before the start of the game.
        "Paris" is designed for "capture points".
        The official release date of the card on the main servers of the game yet.
